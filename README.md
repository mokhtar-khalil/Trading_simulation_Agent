# Trading Simulation

This project is a **trading simulation** entirely designed and implemented by a team of autonomous AI agents using the **CrewAI architecture**.

---

## 👩‍💻 The AI Engineering Team

- **Lead Engineer Agent**  
  Defines the architecture and coordinates the work of the other agents.

- **Backend Engineer Agent**  
  Develops the backend logic in Python based on the specifications provided by the lead engineer.

- **Frontend Engineer Agent**  
  Builds a lightweight Gradio interface to interact with and showcase the backend.

- **Test Engineer Agent**  
  Ensures code quality by writing unit tests for the backend modules.

## 🏗️ How It Was Built
- The project uses **CrewAI commands** to create and coordinate the agents.  
- Each agent contributed to the creation of the Python modules and application structure.
